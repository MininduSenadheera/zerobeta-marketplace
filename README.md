### Backend Services

- Run docker compose up --build to build and start the services.
- when on first run server will automatically seed some data
- u can access the swagger docs by visiting localhost:8000/api/products/docs, localhost:8000/api/orders/docs, localhost:8000/api/users/docs
- test cases can run by running npm run test on each service
- even though microservices usually have multiple dbs I have used as single db as for the ease of demoing of this app. the tables work stand alone without any relationships mocking a db like behaviour
- if you can see this on docker âœ… All services are up. you are good to go.
